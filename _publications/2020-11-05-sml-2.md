## Abstract
Stable patterns that are widely used in todayâ€™s software engineering
in modeling and it plays an important role in reducing the cost and condensing
the time of software product lifecycles. Nowadays, many existing traditional
patterns fail to model the subtle changes in context of the implementation of the
model. As a result, the reusability of the pattern will significantly decrease. The
goal of this paper is to present a pattern language for building a core knowledge
of stable patterns called knowledge map. This paper will also represent the first
attempt towards a machine learning knowledge map representation via stable
patterns as a mean to discover, organize, and utilize machine learning core
knowledge. Each stable pattern focuses on a distinctive activity and provides a
way by which this activity can be conducted efficiently. The presented stable
analysis and design patterns will provide a core knowledge of stable machine
learning domain that is easily extensible, stable through time, and focus on
stable machine learning of Unified (1) Functional and non-Functional
Requirements (2) Unified Design.
