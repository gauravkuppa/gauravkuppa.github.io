## Abstract
Often, changing market dynamics require business applications to
quickly and efficiently adapt to the needs of the ensuing business environment.
Business Rules excel in delivering software solutions that are implicitly
adaptable to changing business requirements; thus they can prove to be an
effective tool to provide necessary flexibility and control for rapidly deploying
changes across a wide array of business operations. When a proper design is
employed, business rules provide a robust and capable way of enabling enter-
prise software that adapts to changing business needs. In other words, business
rules find varied applications and ways of use, for example, managing a pending
problem, using it as production rules and for facilitating collaboration between
various systems, etc. However, despite a plethora of tools and technologies
available, most organizations still find it difficult to define or model workable
business rules explicitly. Furthermore, from a macroscopic point of view, rules
are important and inseparable artifacts in governing a software application to
make it comply with the system goals. In this paper, the current ways to manage
business rules along with their pitfalls are discussed, and therefore, a new
approach for developing rule-based business architectures is proposed. The
proposed approach allows for both managing and reusing business rules.
