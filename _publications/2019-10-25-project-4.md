## Abstract
Why do we need projects? What is the need to carry out a project?
What is the ultimate-goal of any project? These are a few thoughts that crop up
in one’s mind while trying to develop and implement any project. The motivations of this paper are to establish the unified functional and non-functional
requirements of AnyProject for the first time. Our goal is to enable unification
for AnyProject pattern leading to the creation of a stable pattern language and to
enable usability for applications across numerous domains and apply for an
unlimited number of scenarios. The idea is to compare the existing or traditional
model (TM) of a project and software stability model (SSM) of any project
using non-functional requirements as criteria for comparison, evaluation, and
measurements. The significant findings are: (1) The TM can only be applied to
one scenario, unlike the AnyProject Pattern, which can be effectively applied to
unlimited scenarios; (2) The TM requires high maintenance costs and limited
scalability. On the other hand, the SSM definitively cuts down on costs because
it is cognitive knowledge; and (3) In the measurability, the TM fails to model
the essential properties of AnyProject. However, the stable model delineates
essential properties. As a result, the SSM enables stability and unlimited
applicability.
