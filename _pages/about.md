About Me
======
I have completed my bachelors in Computer Engineering at San Jose State University (2020). 
I am interested in use computer vision to extrapolate information from enviornments 
and inform robotic decision-making. I have researched topics such as neural rendering, style 
transfer, stable software systems, and more through. Recently, I have taken a 
liking towards understanding the broader impact of deep learning models to reduce carbon emissions 
from our atmosphere.
