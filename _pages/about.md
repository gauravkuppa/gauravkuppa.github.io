I completed my bachelors in Computer Engineering at San Jose State University (2020). 
I am interested in using computer vision to extrapolate information from enviornments 
to inform robotic decision-making. Furthermore, I have explored the effect of a strategic use 
of deep learning and robotics taken to reduce carbon emissions from our atmosphere.  


Between June 2018 to present, I have researched topics such as neural rendering, style transfer, stable 
software systems, and knowledge graphs at San Jose State University and University of Southern California.
Furthermore, I deployed reinforcement learning algorithms onto simulated robots at Aerospace Corporation.
